<p>It ain't no party without THE PEOPLE!! So a massive thanks to all the bands and DJs for playing for FREE! Thanks to <strong>Young Henrys</strong> for the support, the <strong>Greaser</strong> venue and their staff for getting behind the event, the taste makers who helped pick bands, the photographers, the people who did some promotion online or stuck up a poster, announcers who played the bands on the radio, staff at Zed for trusting me and helping it all come together and last but certainly not least - the volunteers who helped out at the event!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Things like this don’t ‘just happen’ it involves lots of careful planning and hard physical work to go into making something this fun. It’s a multi-genre party that shouldn't happen here BUT IT DOES! Stick the date in your calendar for next year and stay evil 😉</p>
</div><div class="clear"></div></div><div class="more-weird"><h3>Thanks for a record breaking Radiothon! </h3><img src="https://jeff.4zzz.org.au/sites/default/files/2023-08/Radiothon2023_0.jpg"/><div><p>Thanks for celebrating Radio Against the Machine with us this Radiothon. You've made this year's subscriber campaign one of our most successful ever!</p>

<p>Your support means we're able to keep the people and passion that drove 4ZZZ on air. It's another year of giving local artists a platform, giving a voice to marginalised communities and championing the rich cultural fabric of this city.</p>

<p>We're now diving into the job of packing and posting all your subscriber packs and merch. There's a lot, over 1,500, so please be patient as our volunteers get everything to you.</p>

<p>If you were planning to pick up your pack from the station, that's ready for you now. You can pop in to reception between <strong>10am to 4pm Tuesday to Friday</strong> or <strong>10am to 2pm on Saturdays</strong> to collect it. If you originally said you wanted your pack posted out but have changed your mind and want to come in, please give us a call - 3252 1555 - or drop us an email - reception@4zzz.org.au - so we can let you know when we'll have it ready for you.</p>

<p>To get an update on shipping times or to check in on the progress of your order feel free to give us a call or email using those details. One of our volunteers will be able to update you.</p>

<p>Finally, to celebrate the success of this campaign we're going to keep the good times rolling for a little longer, with a few choice prizes still available until the end of August. Head to our <a href="https://4zzz.org.au/radiothon">Radiothon page </a>for the full details.</p>

<p>Thanks for supporting 4ZZZ and Radio Against the Machine.</p>
